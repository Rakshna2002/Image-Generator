This is a simple and fun project where I explored how to generate images using AI ‚Äî specifically, the **Stable Diffusion 2** model from Hugging Face. You just give it a prompt and it creates an image based on that.

---

## What It Does

- Takes a short text prompt and turns it into an image using AI.
- Uses the Stable Diffusion model via Hugging Face‚Äôs `diffusers` library.
- Can run on GPU (CUDA) for faster generation.
- You can tweak how the image is generated ‚Äî like how detailed it should be, what size, and more.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- First, I set up the config: device (`cuda`), seed for consistent results, model IDs, image size, etc.
- Then I load the image generation model (`stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2`) with a few settings to speed things up and make it run on GPU.
- The `generate_image()` function is where the magic happens ‚Äî you pass in a prompt, and it gives you back an AI-generated image.
- That‚Äôs pretty much it! You can plug in any text and get cool visuals back.
